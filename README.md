## Welcome to Agile Automata

Introductory thoughts..

Look at the ecosystem of lean and agile thinking. 

\[Deloit diagram\]

Cut through the mess and arrive ta something better. A large emphasis on soft skills, novelty, personality, and tradition. We are not saying there is no place for these things, we're just saying that we should have a proven and empirically verified system at the core of our delivery engine.

### Rigorous

Based on rigorous scientific research. This value should drive decisions around research and articulation. Provably better. Extrapolating the very best from existing software delivery systems. 

A comparison of existing systems and the creation of a feature-matrix.

Actionable and meaningful metrics.

### Scalable

Recursively Consistent: Existing attempts to scale agile software delivery are internally inconsistent in that the prescribed methods to scale the system contradict the prescribed actions in the prescale version of the system. 

Divisibility of effort: feature teams, user stories, micro-frontends, and micro-services. 

Program and system-level thinking..

### Applicable to non-software engineering domains

An approach that generalizes the iterative and incremental delivery to domains outside of software development. 

There is a massively growing trend to apply these things to all manner of domains. We want to advance that thought and assist in articulating how that application can and should be carried out to the greatest benefit of the practitioners. 

### Remote-first

\[Agile Automata uniquely suited to govern this approach\]

### Instantiated as code

If DevOps is infrastructure as code then why shouldn't our process exist as code as well?

Agile Automata promotes agile organization and the very delivery process itself to exist as functional code. This will be achieved by the utilization of smart contracts with the initial version leveraging project \[Aaragon\].

This means that agile teams can exist autonomously and disintermediated without reliance on a particular vendor's software or centralized service. This also means that agile teams can be radically inclusive and be comprised of members from anywhere in the world and be paid in digital assets without legal or geopolitical restrictions.

### Modular

As there is no universally best data-structure or engineering solution so there is probably no best process. In keeping with these, we advocate the creation of multiple inter-compatible process modules. An initial set of agile process components. 

1.  An Iteration Module
2.  RICE Scoring Module

### Contributable

Cultivate an ecosystem where people can create and share their own agility process smart contract components. Reach out to Agile thought leaders and introduce this initiative to them. Show how elements of Agile Automata can be used in combination with their existing systems or side by side with it. Reach out to the existing blockchain development community to demonstrate how their software delivery can be improved and made more transparent to the benefit of their customers and token holders. 

### Conclusion

The evolving role of the Scrum Master, Agilist, Agile Coach, etc. The prescribed number of Scrum Masters are is inconsistent and out of touch with reality. If they are as-needed then why would we embed them as permanent roles in every feature team? Some are even calling for the aggregation of the position altogether. 

The context of this development is currently the UPMC Enterprises Agile Agile Group (AWG). Much like the Lean, Kanban, and Scrum had their practices and methods tested in the context of Toyota, Microsoft, and The Easel Corporation with a real application, we aim to develop the above ideas by applying and experimenting in a real work context. 

The aim of the Agile Automata vision is to support the creation of self-organizing agile organizations aligned on values, principles, and a shared understanding.
